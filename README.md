Hey there! I'm a Senior Product Security Engineer by day and a security wizard by... well, also by day (and sometimes night, thanks to production issues). I have a knack for securing applications, building tools that make developers' lives easier (and hackers' lives harder), and automating security because manual work is so last decade.

**Disclaimer**: While the grammar and clarity of my blog posts are enhanced by ChatGPT (because even engineers can use a little help), all the details and experiences shared here are purely my own. Stick aroundâ€”this blog might just make you laugh and learn!
